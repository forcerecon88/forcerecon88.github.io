<p>Now that you have got all the parts and components you need it is time to start building.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aliquam porttitor libero sit amet odio iaculis, eu sollicitudin eros venenatis. Maecenas posuere tortor vitae diam egestas, eget pretium ligula aliquam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are multiple steps to this fun process and they begin with a clean workspace. To save yourself trouble in the future, have a neat place where you can assemble all your parts in peace.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="https://dummyimage.com/900x700/efefef/000000" alt="dummy image"></p>
<p>To start with, one should have on hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Phillips screwdriver.</li>
<li>Some sort of way of dispelling static electricity. (Anti-static bracelet, metal radiator)</li>
<li>Some cups or shotglasses in where all the different sized screws and pieces can go in.</li>
  <li>Isopropyl alcohol</li>
</ul>
<p>To begin with, take the processor out of its packaging. AVOID the backside (the golden pins) as touching them with your fingers can seriously harm the component. Hold the processor on its side (similar to a DVD disk) and unlock the processor socket. The processor socket is a big square near the middle of the motherboard. The instructions that come with the motherboard should have a detail steps on how to achieve that. Once unlocked, look and try to find the little golden triangle near one of the corners on the square. That should match up with the golden little triangle on the processor. Place it in and done! You've installed your processor. Just lock the socket once again, but do not pressure the lock too hard. There shouldn't be any pressure anyway. Now, take out the thermal paste and apply it onto the processor. Squeeze out a pea-size of thermal paste onto the centre of the processor. Your CPU cooler should have come with a heatsink. A heatsink is the square area of metal that is attached to the fan. It should visually be obvious if it would fit well with the processor. Place that heatsink onto the processor and tighten the screws tightly. Remember, you're going to place the motherboard that it is attached to on its side eventually. You want the screws to be able to resist the pull of gravity for years to come. If you spilled some thermal paste then just wipe it up with isopropyl alcohol. Once the heatsink is properly screwed in and everything is good, take another look at the motherboard instructions. There should be a specific label onto where you can plug the CPU cooler fan plug in. Many consider this to be the hardest part, so congratulations!</p>

<p>From here on out, the default way of building a PC is pretty systematic. Find your RAM and storage. RAM is perhaps the easiest thing to install in the whole build. Simply take the two sticks (or one stick, for whatever reason) and plug them into the two long slots that visually are perfect to be combined with RAM. RAM only fits one way, but usually there is a physical barrier fitted on to prevent accidental reverse insertion. Simply push (there is, unlike the CPU clamp, quite a lot pressure) and it should fit right in. There may be so much pressure that it may feel as if you're breaking the PC. You're not. Trust me. Once RAM is fitted in, storage comes next. If you have a M.2 NVMe SSD then simply take your screwdriver, unscrew the screw on the M.2 slot (pointed out in your motherboard instructions) and insert the NVMe in. If you have a regular SSD or a hard drive to fit (you most likely do) then slide it into wherever your case says to to put it in and screw that in too. Hard drives usually have a dedicated hard drive bay which is easy to spot. SSD can be put in either their dedicated bay too or some other location. If so, consult the motherboard instructions for that specific scenario. Don't forget that when your lift and attach the motherboard inside the case you will have to use SATA cables (provided) to connect the drives/SSDs to the motherboard.</p>
<p>At this stage, you should be pretty ready to attach your motherboard to your case and lift it onto its side. Line the screw holes in the case with the screw holes in the motherboard and screw. We'll come back later, for now let's focus on the power supply. Most cases will have a spot for it at the bottom but some (quite a few actually) will have it at the top. Look at the back of your case. Where a large square-sized empty space exists, you know that is where the power supply goes. Put it in, screw it and you're done! Make sure, however, that the cables coming back out are surrounded by ample space as it will help you majorly later on.</p>
<h1 id="You're halfway there!">You're halfway there!</h1>
<p>Now, you should take the motherboard that you have attached to the side of the case and actually put it inside the case. There will be less space, but you already most of what can be done. So put it in. Once the motherboard is hanging vertically inside the case, you can connect the SSD/hard drive SATA cables with the motherboard. Same goes for the power supply. Connect them to their respective plugs (pointed out in the motherboard instructions). Once those have been connected, the actual motherboard itself should be connected to the case. The USB headers and other ports you see on the top (or wherever) outside your case have to be somehow connected to the motherboard inside. This is how they are. The power buttons, audio plugs, USB ports, all of them have special headers all over the motherboard and so you will require the motherboard instructions once again. These pins also need to plugged in a certain way, so be wary of that. Last but not least, in terms of connections, the case fans should be connected too. Most case fans are able to connect to each other and only take up only one slot as a result due to them being so numerous. Consider tying these cables with zipties. (Most cases/motherboards come with these included.) They make organisation a breeze and objectively give the build a cleaner feel.</p>
<h2 id="Last Part">Last Part</h2>
<p>You're almost done! Essentially the last step is to install the graphics card. This is very easy to do. Look for a PCIe slot (a wide RAM-slot kind of slot, but bigger and wider). Its location is detailed in the motherboard guide. Identify the back side of your GPU (the protruding backside), take off the plastic protective cover, if there is one, and insert it in. It should lock pretty easily. When plugging your power supply in, you should have noticed that only parts of the available cables could fit into the motherboard. This is perfect. The remaining cables are for the graphics card since it draws so much power.</p>
