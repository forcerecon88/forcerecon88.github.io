<p>Now, most people would agree that building a computer is a daunting task. And it is not that easy for sure. Building a computer can be expensive, difficult, a computer can be too bulky or even too massive or take up too much space. But in this guide I will show you how to build your own computer and prove to you that it can actually be quite cheap, reasonable  and actually not all that difficult to build.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not worry. For many, it seems that this seemingly daunting task is impossible. It is not, and so if you keep by this guide your build will turn out fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The guide below will outline some good examples of what are good picks and how one would be able to pick components regardless of the age and period you happen to be in when you stumble upon this guide.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>First off, you should use PcPartPicker. This is a website that allows you to mix and match different computer components together and allow you to keep them together intact in a dedicated place. It also shows you the price and the compatibility of different various parts which may not always fit together. Its online catalog is extensive and varied, covering most retailers that sell. If you really don't know what to start off with, there are different pre-built sets that exist which you can add and manipulate to adjust or experiment with to get a sense of what is what. Alongside PcPartPicker, one should also make full use of online comparison tools www.videocardbenchmark.net and www.cpubenchmark.net. These two comparison websites compare and contrast CPUs and GPUs by price, performance and, even better, both! Their value/$ feature is especially useful and helps to figure out what is the best performing component at your price level.</p>

<p>All PCs have some essential components that they are made out of: a Motherboard, a CPU (processor), a GPU (graphics card), storage, power supply, RAM, a case and a monitor. As well as peripherals such as: a keyboard, a mouse, headphones (potentially) and speakers (potentially). The factors listed above are often the key ones when evaluating a product and seeing if it is worth buying.</p>
</code></pre>
<p>Depending on the type of PC that you want to build, whether it be for gaming or for office or for some other activity (such as animation or other work-related intensive activities), you will need to pick and choose parts accordingly to fit those different types of activities.</p>
<p>For instance, a gaming PC will require a much more powerful graphics card than an office computer. Conversely, work-related intensive activities such as animation will usually require even more powerful and specific components. But an animation-oriented workload may require more powerful processing power than a graphics card, or the other way round. As such, one must clearly, or at best, somewhat know and understand the purposes that their workstation will fulfill.</p>
<h1 id="The Processor">The Processor</h1>
<p>First off, the processor. Also known as the brains of the computer, it is responsible for the  processing, giving instructions to other parts of the computer, perhaps self-evident given its name.</p>
<h2 id="A good processor is essential for a smooth experience.">A good processor is essential for a smooth experience.</h2>
<p>It is a chip directly connected to the motherboard (I will get to that later) and is responsible for telling and instructing all the other components of the PC what to do. As such, it controls one (but crucial) aspect of a PC's running smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="However, that does not mean you have to shell all out for the newest and most powerful processor.">However, that does not mean you have to shell all out for the newest and most powerful processor.</h3>
<p>As technology has progressed, so have processors, and now almost all are “good” enough for the smooth running of a computer many of us desire. Nowadays you can get away with having a typical $100-$300 processor and it will run your computer very well. Also, processors get very hot, thus practically almost all computers operate some kind of cooler alongside them (I will mention those later on as well).</p>
<h1 id="How to Choose One">How to Choose One</h1>
<p>So, how does one go about choosing themselves a processor? Well, some factors may be: price, performance and compatibility. In the processor world, there are essentially only two competing companies. AMD and Intel vye for dominance and fight for the marketplace. A few years ago I would have said something along the lines of this: "Intel and AMD are both good, however AMD is cheaper and mostly fails to compete with Intel as a peer-competitor. Intel costs more, but you pretty much get what you're paying for." Now, that is a situation that for some years has not been the case. Since around 2017-18 AMD have really stepped their game up and caught up and most people in 2020 would even say overtook Intel. Whilst Intel had been slacking off, AMD apparently was not, and produced very good quality, high-performing and (perhaps most importantly) cheap processors. As of 2020, AMD's processors are now equal, or better than Intel's at the same price range, and cost less in almost every instance, offering not only better single-thread but also multi-thread performance. In general, I do not expect this trend to be reversed too quickly. However, should the market situation change considerably in the near future, then there are some things one should keep in mind when picking a processor for a custom-built PC build. First, always check your budget. This will impose the first set of restrictions on your eventual processor. If you are at the $200 range for instance, then look at other processors (regardless of brand) around that range and try to list them all. Then, try to find out their performance. The site mentioned above (www.cpubenchmark.net) is excellent for this, as every processor on the market is listed in multiple different charts and graphs. Simply searching your corresponding part up will leave you with a single number that is better the higher it is. One can compare those with others and figure out (or at least get a rough mental image) of the performance/value of the component. Also, there exists a $/value metric in the comparison websites mentioned above, but the reason I recommend checking this manually is that not all of them will have a price attached to them from the website, and if they do then it will be either accurate or inaccurate. It is easier and more reliable to know the price one would most likely pay and then expand upon that and figure the $/value out themselves. Finally, one should check the motherboard socket type that the processor will link to. As a basic rule, Intel and AMD will have differing sockets and so will older processors as motherboards also evolve with age. Keeping all these factors together in one's head should be able to allow them to pick a good processor for themselves in any age or era.</p>
<h1 id="The Graphics Card">The Graphics Card</h1>
<p>Next, we come to the graphics cards. GPUs are essentially specialist processors that specialise in visual data and are of particular value to gamers, animators, video renderers, and photo editors.</p>
<h2 id="Especially crucial to Gaming PCs and any other professional work that dabbles in video or photo editing.">Especially crucial to Gaming PCs and any other professional work that dabbles in video or photo editing.</h2>
<p>GPUs, or graphics cards, as they are commonly known, are pieces of hardware that most computers have and for good reason. GPUs are practically the parts that are really good at rendering video. One other name for them is: video cards, self-evident once more.</p>
<h3 id="You should spend most of your money on this.">You should spend most of your money on this.</h3>
<p>GPUs are by far most often the most expensive components in the computer, ranging from $200 to $1,500 and even more. Practically all games rely on these graphics processing units to render the images required and to process them to make games come to life on monitors. Due to their price and their effect on the running of games and professional software, GPUs are often the part that are most looked at and the ones that people think most about before buying. The difference between a good CPU and a decent CPU is pretty unnoticable, whilst the difference between a good GPU and a decent GPU is very noticable, especially if the rest of the build is also not too high-end.</p>
<h1 id="How to Choose One">How to Choose One</h1>
<p>Graphics cards are almost as difficult to choose, if not more so than processors. For starters, graphics cards account for a much greater share of one's machine running smooth than pretty much any other component if a mildly-intensive program is opened. Given the audience for custom self-built computers, pretty much all of the time spent on a computer is also time spent inside a program, whether that be a game, software or any application in general basically. Graphics cards come in a wide variety, and once again, from two major companies. AMD and Nvidia. These two control the GPU market and compete with each other. Historically, AMD has been often the weaker competitor, as it has often been unable to release good high-end equipment, leaving most of that segment of the market relying on Nvidia. That is not to say that AMD is bad, however. AMD does adequately well in the low-end sector, being able to make products that usually can almost match or match those of Nvidia. The mid-end market is probably the best one for them, as here the price/performance ratio is usually better on AMD's side and large amounts of the consumers of this segment do buy AMD. The situation just explained is that of, again, one-two years ago. Historically, at least in past decade, AMD never really has been the better alternative, instead acting as simply another competitor. Knowing this, I believe, can help the average consumer as the established conventions are usually safe to trust and, in case of nothing else (no other knowledge), are a good place to fall back on. Price in this category of components is on AMD's side usually, with examples such as the RX 5700XT being quite popular, even with the release of the new generation, as market shortages have led to avid PC-builders turning back to older stock. Performance clearly is on the side of Nvidia. Nvidia pretty much always has the best performing cards, and their driver optimisation is, as users of AMD GPUs could tell you, better than AMDs for sure. Nvidia charges more but usually gives more. In terms of compatibility, GPUs are able to fit onto all types of motherboards (bar ancient ones) and so are not constrained by this metric. To summarise, if you are a consumer on the higher end of the budget spectrum, then you will probably end up with an Nvidia, given their great performing graphics cards, such as the RTX 3080 and the GTX 1080 TI back in its day. For those with less in their budgets probably would want to compare both, and once again, as in the processor advice above, go to the comparison websites mentioned above and check the price/performace to see the best deal. The low and mid sections of the GPU are full of choice and variety and should be examined for their full potential to provide a good GPU. Keep in mind that Nvidia usually also has more (and better) features than AMD such as ray tracing. This may not be relevant if the purpose is to have it for office, but gamers and professional artists may have that as a must and not just a want. </p>
<h1 id="Storage">Storage</h1>
<p>Storage - we all need it, otherwise where would we all put all our data and files into? Storage is where all data is put into and as such is pretty basic in terms of choosing and selecting in which components to buy.</p>
<h2 id="Great Investment">Great Investment</h2>
<p>Storage comes in all sizes, ranging from 256GB to 2TB and beyond. You may even want to, if you feel like it, choose two different drives, just as I have in my personal setup. One for ultra-fast storage for the operating system and favourite games and one for everything else. That way, you could have Windows, for instance, start up in 10 or 30 seconds, as opposed to 1 to 2 mins. The cost of increasing from a slow drive to a really fast drive is quite minimal. The time reduction you get, however, is quite honestly surreal and the cost/benefit is very much in your favour.</p>
<h3 id="Why a dual system is better and how storage has advanced in recent years.">Why a dual system is better and how storage has advanced in recent years.</h3>
<p>Most users have their storage organised like so: one ultra-fast SSD drive for the housing of their operating system and other files and programs that are frequently used and another slower hard drive where everything else is located in. Thus, one can enjoy all the benefits of advances in storage technology while at the same time keeping a cheaper, more all-purpose drive for other less important things.
<h1 id="How to Choose One">How to Choose One</h1>
<p>Storage is pretty straightforward in being picked. The factors up for consideration here are: price, speed (performance), size (GB/TB) and compatibility (ports). Unlike the other components, price is not such a big deal as storage is not that pricey and also that the size of the drive matters much more. The size of the drive I would emphasise as being the first concern. If the drive is too small, one can always get another one, however that is both inefficient and potentially inconvenient (in the short and long term). Short term, it may mean having to navigate between drives for a lot of files which may lead to annoyance, while long term it can lead to the running out of slots in where drives can be put. That is a distant threat but still present nonetheless. A size of 256GB/512GB/1TB/2TB is usually a good bet. 256GB is almost often used in SSD drives, which are faster but also more expensive, thus people buying smaller sizes so that they can still benefit from faster speeds while at the same time not forking over a fortune. 512GB is used in SSDs also, as well as (though increasingly less and less) hard drives. It is the smaller middleground. 1TB is a good size for an addition of space or if a good deal can be found on a hard drive of such a size. Most people buy 2TB drives for their hard drives, as it strikes a nice balance between space and cost, thus future-proofing the build quite a bit. Once size is sorted out, performance usually comes next and SSD, NVMes and normal hard drives alike are sorted for their inherent speeds. Even though SSDs are much faster than hard drives for instance, vast speed differences exist within these categories. RPM is the measure for hard drives, while MB/s is the measurement for SSDs. In hard drives, RPM comes in two categories mainly: 5600RPM and 7200RPM. In general, one always aims to purchase a 7200RPM drive, as it worth the extra money. Within SSDs exist a category: NVMes. NVMes are insanely-fast Solid State Drives. While an average (say, Samsung) SSD may reach around 500MB/s, a typical NVMe SSD will reach 3200MB/s or higher. Due to that NVMes are priced slightly higher, but not as much as one would think. There is a reason for this. At such scales, the massive increases in speed actually realistically have almost none, or close to zero real-life effect. Nonetheless, some NVMes cost similar or even lower than regular SSDs, so purchasing either is an option. Typically in such a scenario one would pick either the cheaper drive or the more trustworthy brand depending on their priorities. For the operating system, Windows or Mac, a 256GB/512GB SSD is recommended. A great example would be the Adata XPG SX8200 Pro. For around ~€70 you can have a NVMe SSD 512GB that outperforms well-known brands such as Samsung who's flagship SSD is around ~€20 higher and slower. One important thing to note here, and the last point, is compatibility. NVMe SSDs utlise M.2 ports in contrast to the regular SATA ports that SSDs use. If one's motherboard does not possess such a slot then they would not be able to use the NVMe SSD, unless they would want to experiment with adapters and cables. A recommended setup would be: a 256/512GB SSD + a 2TB HDD (hard drive).</p>
<h1 id="The RAM">The RAM</h1>
<p>We move on to RAM, the little bits of ultra-fast memory that acts as a temporary storage in where things such as your tabs and your cache are kept.</p>
<h2 id="Software uses RAM almost constantly.">Software uses RAM almost constantly.</h2>
<p>RAM is sometimes referred to as storage, though you won’t see it called that in this article (to avoid confusion). RAM is important if you want to keep a smooth PC running, as software uses RAM almost constantly, so having an appropriate amount of RAM, as well as fast enough RAM is just as important as a good processor is.</p>
<h3 id="Do you use Google tabs much? If so, take a careful look.">Do you use Google tabs much? If so, take a careful look.</h3>
<p>You may or may not know what relevance this has with RAM. RAM is where all short-term, temporary memory needs are stored. Google tabs, for instance, are notorious for draining RAM. Many other games, programs and applications also use RAM, some quite a lot, and so it is important to have an adequate supply of RAM to ensure smooth running of the computer.</p>
<h1 id="How to Choose One">How to Choose One</h1>
<p>RAM is pretty simple. Price, speed and size are all the considerations you need to make. First, price. RAM is relatively cheap, around the same price as storage, and so we can forget this for now. The price will anyway be around $70-$150 at most. The most important consideration to make is size. Is 8GB, 16GB or even 32GB enough? My recommendation would be 16GB. In the vast majority of cases 16GB is the perfect amount, not too little, not too big. 8GB nowadays is getting outdated and there is no reasonable need for 32GB yet. Onto speed. RAM usually is not that affected by speed at all, and basically any speed you could find would be alright. Therefore, the last and final consideration would be aesthetics. RAM is very different one brand to another, even within a particular line-up. Corsair does simultaneously black and RGB RAM, for instance. RAM is pretty visible from outside the case if one has a glass-paned case and so aesthetics may well play a pretty decisive factor in one's choosing. RAM such as the G.Skill 16GB RGB RAM or the Corsair Vengeance are both good examples of RAM. The G.Skill is bit pricey due to the RGB, but the Vengeance for instance is reasonably priced for its functionality.</p>
<h1 id="Power Supply">Power Supply</h1>
<p>The list is long but it's not over yet. Power supply is one of the most overlooked and yet underrated aspects of building a computer.</p>
<h2 id="Do NOT skimp on this.">Do NOT skimp on this.</h2>
<p>A good power supply means you have enough power to ensure that your PC has enough wattage, crucial to maintaining it functioning well.  A bad power supply is a recipe for disaster. Cheaping out on this one item could mean that your entire build goes to waste. Do NOT try to get every cent possible out of this part, as it could earn you very unfortunate outcomes when your computer one day shuts down or even worse, goes up in smoke.</p>
<h3 id="Go for tried and tested brands - Don't get a cheap one from China">Go for tried and tested brands. - Don't get a cheap one from China</h3>
<p>When I say it, I mean it. A power supply generally should not be bought from some cheap shop where everything is at a discount. </p>
<h1 id="How to Choose One">How to Choose One</h1>
<p>A good power supply is not that hard to come by. A good power supply should have: a trustworthy, reliable brand behind it, a good reputation among the community and only then maybe aesthetics or efficiency ratings. The primary focus when searching for a power supply should be: make sure it is trustworthy. I know I'm repeating this over and over but it really is that important. A faulty power supply can send the rest of your build (thousands of dollars) up in smoke. A warranty is also important, as in the case anything goes wrong then the manufacturing company can come and reimburse you. Once the power supply has been vetted, and should turn to the efficiency ratings in order to see how efficient it is. This is not the most the vital aspect of choosing a power supply but it helps, as more efficient power supplies emit less heat. Finally, one could look at the aesthetics and choose. This may be very irrelevant, however, as power supplies in most cases are invisible anyways (save from the back where only the switch is).</p>
<h1 id="The Case">The Case</h1>
<p>Last but not least, the case. The case is what ensures all your pieces and parts stay together nice and snug.</p>
<h2 id="Should function well and look good.">Should function well and look good.</h2>
<p>A good case can handle the weight of the motherboard (and all the parts attached), has good airflow to ensure the cooling of all your parts, and aesthetically looks pleasing to the beholder. It should also have enough spaces for fans and cables. You’ll probably see what I mean when you build it and evaluate for yourself whether you think there is adequate space for the cables to route through and around inside the case.</p>
<h3 id="A good airflow and good aesthetics.">A good airflow and good aesthetics.</h3>
<p>When choosing yourself a case, make these two a top priority for yourself.</p>
<h1 id="How to Choose One">How to Choose One</h1>
<p>A good case is constituted of many factors. First being the airflow. A case with good airflow is going to have better ventilation and cooling to its parts. This will long-term help you out as well as take the strain off your other fans. Combined with that also is size. There exist different categories of size among cases. MiniITX, MicroATX and ATX. MiniITX is very uncommon and is the smallest form factor of the three. Not many people have such a computer. MicroATX and ATX both are more widespread, with microATX being smaller and ATX being the full-size computer blocks we see. ATX is slightly more popular, though it is also bulkier and microATX parts are found fairly easily too. The case depends on the motherboard size and so one should limit their case search to their motherboard size. Finally aesthetics and price. In the case aesthetics the most important part it can amongst computer parts. As the place where all your parts are housed, the state of the case is how your PC is represented. The varieties on the market are endless and there is almost everything for everyone. Cooler Master's Masterbox 300QL is an excellent example of a microATX case. It is very cheap $50-$60, has good airflow and even a cool design on the front. When all the factors come together like that then you know the case will probably last. Review articles and other such media are very good for (other components as well) seeing which cases are popular and getting ideas and other knowledge.</p>
<h1 id="The Motherboard">The Motherboard</h1>
<p>One of the most important parts, the motherboard. Responsible for commanding all the different components to work together, it is quite important. The motherboard is what provides the ports, and decides what CPU one can have.</p>
<h2 id="Make sure to make it compatible.">Make sure to make it compatible.</h2>
<p>The motherboard is the part of hardware where the graphics card, processor, hard drives, etc. all come together to interact with each other. This interaction is primarily the motherboard's function. As such, make sure to have it compatible with your other parts! Having an Intel CPU on an AMD motherboard will not work. Likewise, you should research and figure out if your motherboard for instance provides a M.2 slot, for instance. A lack of such a port will render you unable to utilise NVM SSDs.</p>
<h3 id="Ports">Ports</h3>
<p>The ports on a motherboard are the ports that you will get when you finish building your PC. HDMI, USB 3.0, the ports that come are the ports that come. You cannot later add more, so be sure to take this into consideration when purchasing a potential motherboard.</p>
<h1 id="How to Choose One">How to Choose One</h1>
<p>So, how to choose one them? Well, choosing by focusing on the price, ports, compatibility, features and aesthetics is a good strategy. Motherboards cost anywhere from $70-$300+. Typically, one can expect a normal, decent motherboard to cost around $100-$150. Maybe $200. Anything higher is usually overpriced or full of extras that really are not that necessary. Next, ports and features. Motherboards are the pieces of hardware responsible for having all the ports that you connect to. When picking a motherboard one should always check if their desired port is there. If, for instance, one really needs an HDMI port or a USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 port then they should thoroughly check over the motherboard to ensure it has it. Features are also an important part of motherboards, as some have features such as WIFI built-in or Bluetooth receivers built-in. These features are far from essential (one can easily attach a WIFI receiver) but may prove to be an extra point in favour of a certain motherboard if you happen to be choosing between two. In my personal experience built-in WIFI is nice to have, especially in the first few weeks when you're setting your PC up. Compatibility should be taken into account, however. Make sure that the motherboard aligns with the brand of processor you're choosing. Lastly, aesthetics matter somewhat, depending on the person. Motherboards are usually blocked from sight so it is alright not to pick the absolute most best-looking.</p>
